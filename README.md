# Deploy Machine Learning Pipeline on Google Kubernetes Engine

![project overview](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*hcwxSdzdVKQNKkBpGBs41g.jpeg)

This is a modified version of https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-deployment-google - the original repo's libraries are out of date, not working properly, so I updated libraries to make it work.

- Deploy a simple machine learning model of predicting insurance charges given one's age, sex, bmi, children,	smoker,	and region.

See the full article for how the model is deployed using Docker and Kubernetes on GCP: [https://medium.com/@jushijun/deploying-a-machine-learning-model-with-docker-and-kubernetes-on-google-cloud-platform-21280db82840](https://medium.com/@jushijun/deploying-a-machine-learning-model-with-docker-and-kubernetes-on-google-cloud-platform-21280db82840).
